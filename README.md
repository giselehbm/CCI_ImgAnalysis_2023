# :microscope: Image Analysis in Life Science 2023

Welcome to the image analysis course organized by the [Centre for Cellular Imaging](https://www.gu.se/en/core-facilities/infrastructure-at-core-facilities/centre-for-cellular-imaging)! 

The material in this page corresponds to the content and practical exercises of Day 1. During this workshop you will:

- [x] See typical examples of what can be done with image analysis
- [x] A basic introduction to digital images and image processing, including digital filter, enhancement techniques
- [x] An overview of a typical image analysis workflow
- [x] How to extract quantitative information from images
- [x] Understand which image artifacts can be corrected by image analysis and which artifacts cannot
